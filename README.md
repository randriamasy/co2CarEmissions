# co2CarEmissions

## Presentation

This repository contains the notebook, eventually the code exploring **CO2 emissions from passenger cars in 2021**. The datasource is available in this [link](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/co2-cars-emission-22).

The goal of this project is to **explore a large data and to monitor some indicators... trend to a fewer emission.**


## Notebook

You can find and browse the notebook under the directory /notebook. The dependencies are directly mentionned in the concerned notebook. 
Before running the notebook, please:
- create a directory /data
